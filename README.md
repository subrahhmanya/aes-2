#AES

## About

Implementation of AES (only for learning purposes). Rijndael was selected by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) as AES. AES is a symmetric cipher. Unlike Rijndael in which block length and key length can be specified to any multiple of 32 bits, AES fixes block length of 128 bits and key length to 128 bits, 192 bits or 256 bits.

## Usage
```bash
# make
# ./aes 
```

## Todo

Enhance support for message greater than 128 bits.
